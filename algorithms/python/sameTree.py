# Given two binary trees, write a function to check if they are equal or not.
# Two binary trees are considered equal if they are structurally identical and the nodes have the same value.

# Definition for a  binary tree node

# Knowledge Point:
# * regular recursion way to solve tree-related problems
# * better way to write judgement statement
