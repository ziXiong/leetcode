# Reverse digits of an integer.
#Example1: x = 123, return 321
#Example2: x = -123, return -321
# Have you thought about this?
# Here are some good questions to ask before coding. Bonus points for you if you have already thought through this!
# If the integer's last digit is 0, what should the output be? ie, cases such as 10, 100.
# Did you notice that the reversed integer might overflow?
# Assume the input is a 32-bit integer, then the reverse of 1000000003 overflows. How should you handle such cases?
# Throw an exception? Good, but what if throwing an exception is not an option?
# You would then have to re-design the function (ie, add an extra parameter).
