# Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.
# For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].
# Note:
# Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.


class Solution:
    # @param nums, a list of integer
    # @param k, num of steps
    # @return nothing, please modify the nums list in-place.
